# Reverse an Array

## Challenge
Write a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with elements in reversed order.

## Approach & Efficiency
I know that unshift is a good way of pushing elements to an array but from the front so i decided to run with that method. Alternatively i could have iterated through the input array from end to beginning and pushed the elements to an empty array. I think the method i chose is shorter but just as readable.

# Shift an Array

# Challenge Summary
Code challenge to insert a number into the middle of an array at index and shift the contained elements.

## Challenge Description
Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and the value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

## Approach & Efficiency
I decided first to create an empty array to add elements to as I believed it would be more difficult to modify the input array. I created an independan counter for the new array as they will have different lengths eventually. I then chose to iterate through the input array and insert each element into the new array with each iteration. Once the iteration reached halfway through the input array rounding up minus 1 I set the new arrays value to equal the input value then continued with the loop. I returned the new array.

# Binary Search

# Challenge Summary
Code challenge to return index of sorted array element equal to input value.

## Challenge Description
Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the array’s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist.
