# Reverse an Array

## Challenge
Write a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with elements in reversed order.

## Approach & Efficiency
I know that unshift is a good way of pushing elements to an array but from the front so i decided to run with that method. Alternatively i could have iterated through the input array from end to beginning and pushed the elements to an empty array. I think the method i chose is shorter but just as readable.
